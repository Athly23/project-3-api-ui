Rick and Morty Slider

Overview:
I made a Rick and Morty website using a slider UI pattern to display facts about the characters on the show. The user can click on the right or left buttons to slide through the available characters and see their stats. I implimentent fetching an API to display the contend along with Javascript (among other programming languages).

Getting started:

You can run the Javascript file (Click on "go live" on VS Code) and it will run on your local browser.
Below is my link to the deployed website.
